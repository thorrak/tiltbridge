Cloud Service Setup
===================

Once your tilt has completed the :doc:`initial_setup` process it is ready to begin scanning for `Tilt Hydrometers`_ and
relay their gravity readings to the cloud. At the moment, TiltBridge supports three cloud service targets for this data:

* `Fermentrack`_
* `Brewers Friend`_
* Google Sheets


Setting up TiltBridge for Fermentrack
-------------------------------------

The TiltBridge was designed by the primary author of `Fermentrack`_ and is designed with Fermentrack support in mind.
In most cases, your TiltBridge can be linked to a single Fermentrack installation from directly within the Fermentrack
app as part of the "Add Gravity Sensor" workflow

Adding the TiltBridge to Fermentrack
************************************

#. Connect to your Fermentrack installation and log in (if necessary)
#. From the Device menu choose ``Add Gravity Sensor``
#. On the resulting page, choose ``Tilt Hydrometer`` and then select the connection type ``TiltBridge``
#. Click the ``Add New TiltBridge`` link. Fermentrack will automatically scan for TiltBridge devices on your network.
#. If your TiltBridge device appears, click the "Add" button. Fermentrack will attempt to complete the remaining setup steps automatically. Proceed to Adding Tiltbridge-connected Tilts to Fermentrack
#. If your TiltBridge device **is not** in the list you will need to add it manually. In the form at the bottom of the page, enter the mDNS ID you selected during :doc:`initial_setup` and enter a name by which Fermentrack will identify your TiltBridge.
#. Click the `Create TiltBridge` button. Fermentrack now knows to expect your TiltBridge, but you will need to finish the setup on the TiltBridge manually.


If you need to manually configure the TiltBridge
################################################

If Fermentrack was not able to automatically configure your TiltBridge (either because the automatic configuration failed
or because you created the TiltBridge manually) you will need to manually set the Fermentrack URL on the TiltBridge
settings page.

#. Identify the IP address of your Fermentrack installation
#. On a device connected to the same network as the TiltBridge, navigate to http://tiltbridge.local/ (replace tiltbridge in this URL with the mDNS name you set during initial setup)
#. Click the ``Settings`` link at the top of the dashboard
#. In the ``Fermentrack URL`` field enter http://<fermentrack_ip_address>/tiltbridge/ and click ``Update``

Fermentrack and TiltBridge are now configured to properly communicate. You can now set up Tilts connected using
TiltBridge in Fermentrack.


Adding TiltBridge-connected Tilts to Fermentrack
************************************************

Once the TiltBridge and Fermentrack are configured to communicate, you can add the Tilt hydrometers to Fermentrack
that will be pushed via the TiltBridge.

#. Connect to your Fermentrack installation and log in (if necessary)
#. From the Device menu choose ``Add Gravity Sensor``
#. On the resulting page, choose ``Tilt Hydrometer`` and then select the connection type ``TiltBridge``
#. Select the TiltBridge you just set up
#. Enter the name, temp format, and color, and click ``Create Sensor``

Congratulations - your Tilt will now send gravity readings to Fermentrack.




Setting up TiltBridge for Brewers Friend
----------------------------------------

With a premium `Brewers Friend`_ account, you can store temperature and gravity readings from your Tilt Hydrometer as
part of your brew logs. After you set up your TiltBridge to push to Brewers Friend, it will create stream devices for
each of the detected Tilts which can then be subsequently attached to your brew logs. To comply with rate limits
placed by Brewer's Friend, data is first sent about 1 minute after startup, and subsequently no more than once every
15 minutes.

.. note:: Due to ESP32 hardware limitations, all connections to Brewers Friend are done over HTTP


Configuring the TiltBridge for Brewers Friend
*********************************************

To configure TiltBridge to use Brewer's Friend, you will need to obtain your Brewer's Friend API key and provide it to
TiltBridge.

#. Go to `Brewers Friend`_ and log in to your account
#. Click the ``Profile`` button in the upper right, and click ``Account``
#. Copy the API key (not one of the URLs) to your clipboard
#. On a device connected to the same network as the TiltBridge, navigate to http://tiltbridge.local/ (replace tiltbridge in this URL with the mDNS name you set during initial setup)
#. Click the ``Settings`` link at the top of the dashboard
#. In the ``Brewers Friend API Key`` field paste the API key you copied earlier and click ``Update``


Testing Brewers Friend
**********************

Once the Brewer's Friend API key is provided, the TiltBridge will begin transmitting gravity data once every 15 minutes.
Following the first data transmission, you can easily check in Brewer's Friend to see if the data was received.

#. Go to `Brewers Friend`_ and log in to your account
#. Click the ``Profile`` button in the upper right, and click ``Account``
#. Click the ``Device Settings`` button on the right
#. In the ``Device Settings`` pane click ``Show All`` (to the right of ``All Brew Sessions``)
#. All Tilt devices should appear in the list as ``Stream`` devices and will be identified by their color

.. note:: Per Brewer's Friend guidelines, data is only pushed once every 15 minutes. As a result, it may take up to 15 minutes for the device to be created or for the first points to appear.


Setting up TiltBridge for Google Sheets
---------------------------------------

Similar to TiltPi or the Tilt Hydrometer app, TiltBridge supports logging to Google Sheets. Setting up Google Sheets is
more involved than either `Fermentrack`_ or `Brewers Friend`_, but provides a free, easily accessible cloud data service.

Due to hardware constraints, TiltBridge cannot communicate via HTTPS, and must rely upon a proxy service hosted
at `tiltbridge.com`_ to translate between HTTP and HTTPS. If these constraints are removed in the future, HTTPS support
may be readded to allow the TiltBridge to directly communicate with Google Sheets. As a result of the proxy requirement,
TiltBridge will not transmit data to Google Sheets more than once every 15 minutes.


Preparing Google Sheets to Receive Data
***************************************

.. todo:: Add this


Configuring the TiltBridge for Google Sheets
********************************************

Once you have prepared Google Sheets to receive data pushed by the TiltBridge, you will need to update a handful of
settings on the TiltBridge itself so that it knows where to send the data.

#. On a device connected to the same network as the TiltBridge, navigate to http://tiltbridge.local/ (replace tiltbridge in this URL with the mDNS name you set during initial setup)
#. Click the ``Settings`` link at the top of the dashboard
#. In the ``Google Script URL`` field paste the Google Script URL you made note of during the preparation step above and click ``Update``
#. After the URL is updated, enter your Gmail (or Google Apps) email address in the ``Google Script Email`` field and click ``Update``

Your TiltBridge should now be configured to send data to Google Sheets. To begin logging a Tilt you will need to enter a
sheet name for the data to be logged to.


Logging a Beer with TiltBridge and Google Sheets
************************************************

After configuring the TiltBridge each Tilt your TiltBridge detects can be individually logged to its own sheet on Google
Sheets. To enable logging, you will need to specify a sheet name in TiltBridge. If this sheet does not exist on Google
Sheets it will be created. If the sheet does exist, new data points will be appended to it.

#. On a device connected to the same network as the TiltBridge, navigate to http://tiltbridge.local/ (replace tiltbridge in this URL with the mDNS name you set during initial setup)
#. Click the ``Settings`` link at the top of the dashboard
#. Type a name for the Google Sheet to which you want to log data points in the appropriate ``Tilt Sheet Name`` field and click ``Update``

Once this is complete, your Tilt will begin logging data points to the sheet name you specified. If the sheet does not
exist, it will automatically be created.

.. note:: Points are only pushed to Google Sheets once every 15 minutes. As a result, it may take up to 15 minutes for the sheet to be created or for the first points to appear.
