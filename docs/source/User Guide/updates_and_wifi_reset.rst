Other TiltBridge Features/Settings
==================================

TiltBridge also has features to simplify both keeping your TiltBridge up to date as well as resetting the WiFi network
settings.

Updating your TiltBridge Firmware
---------------------------------

To update your TiltBridge firmware, use a web browser to log into your TiltBridge, click the "x" option at the top of the
page, and then click the "Update Firmware" button. Your TiltBridge will automatically locate the latest firmware, download
it, and install it on your device.

.. warning:: While the TiltBridge is performing the OTA firmware update, do not attempt to power down or reset the device. This may cause the update to fail which can result in permanent damage to your device.


Resetting your WiFi Configuration Settings
------------------------------------------

There are two options for resetting your TiltBridge's WiFi configuration settings.

If you are able to log into your TiltBridge using a web browser, do so, and then click the "x" option at the top of the page,
then click the "Reset WiFi Settings" button. This will cause your TiltBridge to delete its network configuration & allow
it to be configured using the TiltBridge configuration AP.

If you are not able to log into your TiltBridge using a web browser, you can also reset the WiFi settings using the "boot"
button (if available) on your TiltBridge device. To use this, simply push the "boot" button on the TiltBridge while the
device is scanning for Tilt Hydrometers. After you've pushed the button once, press it a second time within several
seconds to confirm that you want to reset your WiFi settings.
