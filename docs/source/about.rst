What is TiltBridge?
===================

`TiltBridge`_ is a single-component hardware solution for bridging the gap between your `Tilt Hydrometer`_'s Bluetooth signal
and the internet. View your beer's gravity or transmit your Tilt's signal to the cloud simply, easily, and without needing a
spare phone or Raspberry Pi. A TiltBridge can be built without any soldering or electrical know-how, and set up in 10
minutes or less.

A TiltBridge consists of an ESP32-based controller (the :doc:`hardware`) and the TiltBridge Firmware (the software). The
hardware can be purchased for as little as $10 (less if you don't want a screen!), and the software is available on
GitHub for free.
