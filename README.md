#### Bring WiFi to your Tilt Hydrometer

TiltBridge is a single-component solution for bridging the gap between your Tilt Hydrometer's Bluetooth signal and the internet. Eliminate the need for a spare phone/tablet to live next to your fermenter without losing the ability to log your gravity data.

#### Log to the Cloud

TiltBridge automatically logs your data to the following cloud data services:

* [Fermentrack](https://www.fermentrack.com/)
* [Brewer's Friend](http://www.brewersfriend.com/)
* [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app)
* Google Sheets


#### Features

* One-glance Gravity Readings
* Gravity Web Dashboard
* Log multiple Tilts at once
* Log to multiple cloud services simultaneously
* Single component build


#### Build a TiltBridge

Building a TiltBridge is simple - the hardest decision in most cases is the enclosure. For more information, read the [documentation](http://docs.tiltbridge.com/).


#### Requirements

TiltBridge requires an ESP32-based controller, properly flashed with the TiltBridge firmware.
